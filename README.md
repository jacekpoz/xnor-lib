xnor-lib is a library used in the xnor chat [desktop client](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-desktop-client/), [android client (WIP)](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-android-client) and [server](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-server/)

## Prerequisites
[Java 8/1.8](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk8/) whatever you wanna call it I prefer java 8
I guess that's it if you wanna compile it get some kotlin compiler that compiles to java 8 Idk man I use intellij so it all just works there you should probably use it too if you wanna compile this

## Installation
I haven't figured out how to upload the jar to maven yet but someday I will, right now you can download the library and the sources in the [releases tab](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-lib/releases/) but if you wanna run the server or client or whatever it's already included in there so you don't need to download it

## Usage
idk what to tell you man the classes and shit should be self explanatory and I added some docs so that should be enough just look at the code you can figure it out I believe in you

## Contributing
I guess if you have something to fix just post an issue and I'll take a look at it
