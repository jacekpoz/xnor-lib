# xnor-lib

xnor-lib is a library used in the xnor chat [desktop client](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-desktop-client/), [android client (WIP)](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-android-client) and [server](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-server/)

## Installation

I haven't figured out how to upload the jar to maven yet but someday I will, right now you can download the library and the sources in the [releases tab](https://github.com/jacekpoz/xnor-lib/releases/)

## Contributing
I guess if you have something to fix just post an issue and I'll take a look at it
